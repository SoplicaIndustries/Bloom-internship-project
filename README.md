# Bloom-internship-project
This is a project that me and my friend were developing at the time of our first internship. It is a web application made with C#, ASP.NET and DevExpress controlls.
This was our first time developing API by ourselves, and also first time with pre-developed controlls. 
Billing service, which is the original name is a simple CRUD application with additional PDF invoice generation.
I was mainly doing backend, while my friend was working on frontend.
